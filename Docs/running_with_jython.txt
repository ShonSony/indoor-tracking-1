So we want to run with Jython in order to leverage the capacity to write extensions in Java / use 3rd party Java classes, specifically Weka.

A good alternative would be to just use a CPython SVM :)

But challenge accepted...

So, the main problem is picking the right versions of software, and the fact that the rest_framework plug-in isn't entirely Jython compatible.

For starters, use the jyton_backend.txt requirements to get the right versions.

You must use the Jython2.7 beta.

Ensure that the environment variable 'CLASSPATH' is set to include all necessary jars including mysql driver (no other option seems to work).

export CLASSPATH='/home/alex/workspace/Masters/Fingerprints_django/mysql-connector-java-5.1.24-bin.jar'

Change:

/usr/share/jython2.7b1/Lib/site-packages/rest_framework/templatetags/rest_framework.py:239

uncomment the following lines (no 'idna' support in Jython yet):
                #try:
                #    domain = domain.encode('idna').decode('ascii')
                #except UnicodeError:
                #    continue

Change:

/usr/share/jython2.7b1/Lib/site-packages/django_filters/__init__.py

Remove the '.' from the first line

May have been something else too....

Ah bugger.

More errors.

Giving up for now - what a waste of time!
