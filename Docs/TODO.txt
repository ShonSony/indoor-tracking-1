Hi me.

Where I'm up to is:

 $ Run South migration to add Owner field to BaseStation
 $ Check that BaseStations can be edited properly:
   - if an SSID changes, the change can be put in easily.
 + Switched to a hyperlinked API.
 $ Test Fingerprint saving
   - Understand deserialization using REST framework
 * Test Location retrieval
